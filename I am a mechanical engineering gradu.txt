I am a mechanical engineering graduate with a passion for UI/UX design. I have completed a professional course in UI/UX design, gaining expertise in user research, market analysis, wireframing, prototyping, and user testing. My experience includes designing mobile apps and websites, with proficiency in tools such as Figma, Adobe XD, Photoshop, Illustrator, Miro, and Balsamiq. I would greatly appreciate it if you could refer me to any open positions at your esteemed company.
